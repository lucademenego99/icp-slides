# Interactive Code Playgrounds - Slides

Slides created with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) for the Interactive Code Playgrounds project, hosted directly from the repository as a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

`python-summer-school.com` is an example [Redbean](https://redbean.dev/) file providing all slides from the "python-summer-school" directory within an environment working without an internet connection. To test it, download the file and run it!
