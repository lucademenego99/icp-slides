                One day, we would like to simplify this quite a bit, but this is promising for a quick prototype!

                For now, we can make use of all the nice features that you might expect from the components we used.
            </section>

            <section>
                And this is all front-end code! Which means this works even if you are offline (encourage to try).

                Or, more realistically, this means you can integrate ICPs in pretty much any LMS or platform without installing complex components.
